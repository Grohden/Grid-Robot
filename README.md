# Grid-Robot
Hello there, here you can find some implementations of a 'fake' robot in a virtual grid.
It works with three simple commands:
<strong>L,M,R</strong>.Wich means Left, Move, Right.(I think i do not need to explain what those three do :p)</br>
it returns:<strong>(x,y,Cardinal Point.)</strong>
An example:
Robot MMRM

It will  move 2 times, and then turn to right and move again.</br>
The return should be: (2,1,East)
